    <h1>Windows Plus - Part 2</h1>
    <p>
        The reason I am calling is to see if you have had any plans to replace and upgrade your windows?  Not sure how old your windows are but most likely upgrading your windows will not only give your home a new look but also be more energy efficient.  We have financing options available with up to 14 months of no payments or interest. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We're currently doing free consultations in your area to show how easy and affordable it can be to upgrade your windows.  Have you had any plans or desire to replace any windows?
