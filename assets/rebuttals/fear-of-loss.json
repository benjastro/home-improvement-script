    "Hit them with Fear of Loss" : "What is scary about roofing is most of the time you don’t see a leak until it happens – see the underlayment of the roof is what goes under the shingles to make the home water tight and most of the time this is a 10-15 product that starts to fail and is not visible to anyone who is not inspecting it.  You owe it to yourself to have someone come out for a no cost inspection and put your mind at ease, or help you with an unforeseen problem before it gets bad!"
